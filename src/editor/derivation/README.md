# `src/editor/derivation/` — the incremental derivation graph (M1)

The LSP-style pipeline that turns **file changes** (from the merged `src/editor/filesync/` layer) into
the **derived `context::kernel::World`** — EditorKernel as a restartable incremental derivation engine
over project files (**L-19**, **L-22**). The RuntimeKernel never parses authored files; it consumes this
graph's output (**L-24**). The graph mechanics were the M1 deliverable; the
canonical parse node now delegates to the REAL canonical-JSON serializer (`src/editor/serializer/`,
M2 issue #42) behind the same stable seam the M1 placeholder occupied — the graph never changed.

Library target: **`context_derivation`** (links `context_filesync` for the `ReconcileChange` input type,
`context_kernel` for the derived `World` + the internal `EventBus`, `context_serializer` for the
canonical parse node's real body, and `context_warnings`). Namespace:
`context::editor::derivation`.

## What it implements

- **Derivation-graph skeleton (L-22)** — `DerivationGraph::apply()` ingests a file-sync `ReconcileChange`
  + the authored bytes: `source file → canonical parse → derived World`. One entity per source file
  carries a `DerivedSource{canonical_hash, generation}`. `run_pass()` (re)derives the dirty subgraph and
  advances a monotonic **derived-world generation counter**, published on the internal event bus as
  `DerivationPassEvent` (the bridge-daemon's client event stream forwards it, R-BRIDGE-008).
- **Incremental re-derive (L-22)** — only nodes in the pending dirty set are visited, and each is
  **content-hash memoized**: a dirty node whose canonical form is unchanged (e.g. a whitespace-only
  edit, or a save-with-no-edit) is skipped, so its derived value and per-node generation are frozen.
- **Derivation-side backpressure (R-FILE-013)** — a write **burst coalesces** into batched passes (one
  batched pass per burst, never one pass per event); a **queue-depth / bounded-lag signal**
  (`BackpressureSignal`, also emitted as `BackpressureEvent` on overload transitions) lets cooperative
  clients self-throttle; and under overload the pass **load-sheds** — the visible/queried subgraph
  derives first, the rest defers to later passes.
- **Read-your-writes barrier (R-CLI-006)** — `apply()` returns a `WriteTicket{canonical_hash,
  generation_after}`. `query_barrier.h` bounded-blocks a read until the derived world reflects it:
  `wait_for_hash` is the **own-write** barrier (`--after-hash`, robust under load-shedding),
  `wait_for_generation` is the **foreign-generation** barrier (`--after-generation`); an unsatisfiable
  barrier **times out explicitly** rather than hanging.

## Known M1 simplifications (deliberate, documented)

- ~~The canonical parse is a whitespace-normalizing placeholder~~ **RESOLVED (M2 wave 1, #42)**: the
  parse node delegates to the real canonical-JSON serializer (`src/editor/serializer/` — R-FILE-001
  key order / number formatting / NFC, the two-hash split, and the committed test-vector corpus).
  Non-JSON content passes through raw (raw ≡ canonical — the binary-sidecar rule); the per-kind
  schema model still lands in later M2 tasks.
- **The derived World is a flat file→entity map.** Composition / instantiation across scenes
  (parse → validate → **compose → instantiate**, the rest of the L-22 pipeline) lands with the M2 data
  model; here each source derives to one node with no cross-node dependency edges yet.
- **The "bounded-block" is modeled as a bounded number of passes**, not real threads/sleeps — matching
  how a daemon drains its queue while a query waits, and keeping the whole layer deterministic (no
  concurrency in M1; the daemon's threading model is a later task).
- **The backpressure signal is produced, not yet wired to the client stream.** It surfaces on the
  kernel-internal `EventBus`; forwarding it onto the R-BRIDGE-008 client event stream is the bridge's
  concern. The documented max dirty-set latency these bounds enable is benchmarked by the R-FILE-011
  bench task.

## Tests

`ctest --preset dev` runs each `derivation-*` executable (see `CMakeLists.txt`): the canonical-parse
seam (real-canonicalizer formatting-insensitivity, non-JSON passthrough, fixpoint, determinism,
encoding heals), the end-to-end change→World+generation flow
(create / removal / empty-pass), incremental re-derive + memoization + coalescing, backpressure
(coalescing, the queue-depth signal, load-shed to the visible subgraph, event publication), and the
read-your-writes barrier (own-write hash, foreign generation, explicit timeout, load-shed robustness).
