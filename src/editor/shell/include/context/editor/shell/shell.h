// The Shell itself (design 03 §1) — `WindowManager` owns N `EditorWindow`s, and each `EditorWindow`
// binds one native window to one OSR browser, one compositor, and one input arbiter.
//
// THE OWNER LOOP. Production runs `multi_threaded_message_loop=false` with an INTEGRATED pump on the
// shell's main thread: one thread drains the OS queue, drives the browser's message work, and
// composites. The spike's "prod = multi-threaded + mutex" caveat is REJECTED by the design in favour
// of this single-threaded owner loop — simpler invariants, and the compositor already decouples
// engine frame rate from CEF's 60 Hz, which was the only thing the extra thread bought.
//
// `pump_once` is therefore the whole loop body, and it takes the clock as an argument rather than
// reading one. That is what makes the entire shell lifecycle — resize, DPI change, focus, input
// round-trip, popup, placement persistence, teardown — a deterministic ctest instead of something
// only a human at a real window can observe.
//
// THE SHELL IS AN ORDINARY CLIENT (D10). It reaches the daemon through the published `context_client`
// SDK, never by linking the kernel's own modules, and it MUST present the D20 attach token —
// enforcement has been on since e02. `guard_shell_attach` refuses to even ATTEMPT an unauthenticated
// attach, so a missing token is reported as what it is rather than surfacing later as an opaque
// `attach.denied` that reads like a transport fault.

//     closes its browser — but MOVES the session's bridge, daemon client and captured surfaces into
//     a graveyard that is emptied ONLY by ~WindowManager. `pump_once` does the same for a window

//     destroy the manager AFTER `shell::cef::shutdown()`, which `editor_main.cpp` does by declaring
//     it in the enclosing scope. This is CE #319 generalised from one process-wide teardown to N
//     mid-process ones: `CloseBrowser` returning is not proof CEF is done with the client.
//   * **Ids are never reused.** A stale id from a destroyed window resolves to nullptr forever
//     rather than silently addressing a different window — which is what e10b's cross-window moves
//     would otherwise do to a panel.
