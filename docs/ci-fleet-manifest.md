# CI fleet manifest (R-QA-012)

## What the manifest is

A **versioned** manifest that maps **every CI-enforced requirement to the named runner class that
enforces it** — OS/hardware, GPU presence, isolation class (perf-isolated vs shared), and build
flavor (dev / sanitizer / release / deterministic / spike). Without stating what CI *is*, an
unprovisioned gate becomes a silently-skipped gate. The manifest makes the fleet a designed,
versioned artifact and every gap **honest**: a gate whose runner class is **not yet provisioned** is
marked **advisory until provisioned** — visibly degraded, never silently green.

## Runner classes

| Runner class | OS / hardware | Isolation | GPU | Provisioned |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `gh-ubuntu-shared` | ubuntu-latest, GitHub-hosted | shared | no | ✅ |
| `gh-macos-shared` | macos-latest, GitHub-hosted | shared | no | ✅ |
| `gh-windows-shared` | windows-latest, GitHub-hosted | shared | no | ✅ |
| `perf-linux-bare-metal` | Linux-x64, bare-metal perf box | **perf-isolated** | no | ❌ (R-QA-009 v1) |
| `determinism-matrix` | Linux-x64 · Win-x64 · macOS-ARM64 | shared | no | ❌ (M6) |
| `gpu-runner` | Linux-x64 + GPU | shared | **yes** | ❌ (M4) |
| `n-daemons-host` | Linux-x64 multi-worktree host | perf-isolated | no | ❌ (R-FILE-011) |

A shared GitHub-hosted runner **cannot** host an R-QA-009 performance floor (rule 1 of the
[perf-gate methodology](perf-gate-methodology.md)); those floors map to `perf-linux-bare-metal`.

## Red-X policy taxonomy (ROADMAP §6)

Every gate carries exactly one written red-X policy:

- **blocking** — merge stops when the gate red-Xes.
- **advisory** — reported + tracked, does **not** stop the merge. **Every gate whose runner class is
  not yet provisioned is advisory** (the R-QA-012 rule the validator enforces).
- **quarantine-with-issue** — a known-flaky gate, auto-quarantined WITH an owned issue, kept running +
  visible for trend, **never silently retried to green**.

⏳ = advisory **until its runner class is provisioned**. The R-QA-008 M1-exit suites (kernel,
file-sync, and the R-QA-010 fault-injection harness) ride the `build` gate — their ctest
registrations run on every `build (<os>)` leg. The five `m1-exit-*` gates are the ROADMAP §1
M1 Exit criteria themselves (issue #36): the `m1-exit-<n>-*` ctest family under
`src/tests/integration/`, run by the dedicated "M1 exit gate (5 criteria, blocking)" step of the
`build` job on all three OS legs (the runner class shown is the representative leg).

**The two-tier R-FILE-011 benchmark (issue #38, ROADMAP §6 tiering):** `bench-attach-10k` is the
**per-PR blocking 10k proxy** on the REAL attach pipeline (filesync reconcile index + derivation
graph + daemon boot via the `context bench` subject) — the JOB blocks (the real path must run
green + the per-stage budget-table extraction must succeed), while the perf NUMBERS stay advisory
(in-job perf gate is `continue-on-error`) because a shared runner cannot satisfy R-QA-009 rule 1.
The nightly `bench-100k-nightly` job (`.github/workflows/bench-nightly.yml`) runs the FULL 100k
benchmark + the dense-reference, session-query-p99, sustained-backpressure, and N-daemons
scenarios as an **advisory trend** on `gh-ubuntu-shared`; the nightly gates' `runner_class`
columns name the class that will make each a real floor once provisioned (never silently green).
The normative budget allocation lives in [`latency-budget-table.md`](latency-budget-table.md).

## How CI consumes it (the R-QA-012 tie)

`tools/check_fleet_manifest.py` runs in the `python-tests` job on every PR:

```bash
python3 tools/check_fleet_manifest.py --manifest docs/ci-fleet-manifest.json \
    --ci-workflow .github/workflows/ci.yml \
    --ci-workflow .github/workflows/bench-nightly.yml
```

(`--ci-workflow` is repeatable: per-PR gates live in `ci.yml`, the nightly benchmark gates in
`bench-nightly.yml`; a `ci_job_id` must exist in at least one given workflow.) It fails the build
(exit 1) when the manifest drifts out of self-consistency, and exit 2 on a config error. It
enforces:

1. Every gate references a **declared runner class**.
2. Every `red_x_policy` is one of the three taxonomy values; every `tier` is `per-PR` or `nightly`.
3. **Advisory-until-provisioned**: a gate whose runner class has `provisioned: false` MUST be
   `advisory` (never blocking, never silently green).
4. Every `quarantine-with-issue` gate **names an `issue`**.
5. Every gate with a non-null `ci_job_id` maps to a **real job** in the live workflow (the
   consumption/sync check — the manifest cannot claim a CI job that does not exist).

`tools/tests/test_check_fleet_manifest.py` is the R-QA-013 coverage for the validator itself.

## Maintenance

- **Adding a CI gate** → add a manifest row (runner class + tier + red-X policy + `ci_job_id`) in the
  same PR; the validator fails if the `ci_job_id` has no matching job.
- **Provisioning a runner class** → flip `provisioned: true` and promote its advisory gates to
  `blocking` (and drop any `continue-on-error` in the workflow). Provisioning a runner class is a
  milestone de-risk item like any other dependency.
- **Bump `manifest_version`** on any schema change.
